## Beautiful Interface
It has a simple interface that even terminal newbies will have no issues learning. As part of a minimalistic user interface, it relies on a few commands to get the job done. If you need help with the commands, just type `e` to bring the detailed help menu.

## Cutting edge features
Between its many fetaures, and belive me, it got many; we can find a numbering system converter. It can be toggle with a simple command: `h` for Hexadecimal and `b` for Binary. *Note: if use without specifying a number, it will produce unexpected functionality*.

The LTC has, at it's core, [Meval](https://github.com/rekka/meval-rs), a math expression parser and evaluator that is the powerhouse and the reason for the existance of the LTC.

## For the future
New features, impruvements and more will be comming *eventually* as I keep coming back to it.

You may say this is just a wrapper for [Meval](https://github.com/rekka/meval-rs), but it's more than that, is's the **Lazy Terminal Calculator**.
